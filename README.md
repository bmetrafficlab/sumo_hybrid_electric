Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) play a crucial role in sustainable transportation, enhancing fuel efficiency and lowering emissions relative to traditional combustion engine vehicles. As the transportation sector greatly impacts global energy use and emissions, advancing HEV technology and its integration into traffic systems is key. This project seeks to develop an adaptable HEV engine/fuel consumption model based on the 2010 Toyota Prius, using variables like speed and acceleration to facilitate real-time applications and aid in environmental policy and traffic management decisions. The goal is to support the shift towards greener mobility by accurately modeling and analyzing HEV performance. This initiative also addresses the complexity of existing HEV models by providing a simpler, yet robust approach that can be adapted for various HEV types, promoting wider application and facilitating advancements in HEV technology for a sustainable future.
